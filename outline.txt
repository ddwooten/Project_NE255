Outline:
The goal of this project will be to determine a design space in which a LiF
based, single fluid, molten salt reactor could opperate. The parametric 
variables will primarily be the pin-pitch of the Zirconium-Hydride moderator
rods, the fraction of core volume which the un-moderated upper-plenum 
occupies, and the feed rate of new fuel. The variable to be optimized will be
the final burnup off all fed fuel with a target goal of 98%.
Methods:
The Monte-Carlo code SERPENT will be employed both for criticality evaluation,
a non-negotiable in the design space ( the reactor must be critical ) as well
as burnup evaluation. For the proper modelling of the burnup evolution a
modified form of the SERPENT code will be used in which Dr. Aufiero has 
provided modified source code files to enable SERPENT to properly account
for the continuos refueling and reprocessing that occurs in a molten salt
reactor of this type.
